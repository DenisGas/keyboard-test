        <p class="about-desc">
          Use this virtual keyboard to test your physical keyboard. Press any
          key to see if it works correctly. The virtual keyboard will highlight
          the keys as you press them.

        <div class="about-example">
          <div class="key active"><p>F</p></div>
          <span>— This is how a key looks when you hold it down.</span>

          <div class="key pressed"><p>F</p></div>
          <span
            >— This is how a key looks after you release it, indicating it works
            properly.</span

          The keyboard is the primary tool for entering text on your computer or
          laptop. However, issues like sticky keys, incorrect symbols, or
          unresponsive keys can occur over time. This online tool helps you test
          your keyboard to determine if the problem lies in the hardware or
          software.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Simply press the keys on your physical keyboard. If a key works
          correctly, it will light up in gray while pressed and turn yellow
          after you release it on the virtual keyboard. If a key sticks or
          doesn’t respond, you’ll notice it doesn’t highlight as expected.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          This online keyboard tester is a simple and convenient way to check
          your keyboard without downloading any software. It works directly in
          your browser, making it accessible anytime.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Testing your keyboard is straightforward but requires attention. Press
          each key to ensure it functions properly. If a key doesn’t work as
          expected, you may need to clean your keyboard, replace it, or check
          for software issues.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Mechanical keyboards remain the most popular choice for typing due to
          their tactile feedback and durability. However, they can still
          experience issues like double-typing, false presses, or stuck keys.
          Use this tool to identify and troubleshoot these problems.
